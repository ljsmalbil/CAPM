        A beta coefficient can measure the volatility of an individual stock compared to the systematic
        risk of the entire market.

        For comparison:

        * . beta = 0 indicates no correlation with the chosen benchmark (e.g. NASDAQ index )
        * . beta = 1 indicates a stock has the same volatility as the market
        * . beta > 1 indicates a stock thatâ€™s more volatile than its benchmark
        * . beta < 1 is less volatile than the benchmark

        Thus, a beta of 1.7 is 70% more volatile than the benchmark
